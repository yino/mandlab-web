<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing Configuration Loading**

I'm currently focused on how to handle `.env` files within a Vite project. It appears the core issue stems from accessing environment variables with `import.meta.env` and the attempt to access `VITE_ASSET_PREFIX`. I'm examining this line of code specifically, as it is flagged by the linter as an error. This likely indicates an incorrect configuration or access method for the `.env` variables.


**Exploring Environment Loading**

I've determined the primary hurdle is correctly loading `.env` variables within `vite.config.ts`. The initial approach using `import.meta.env` is unsuitable because this file executes in a Node.js environment, not the client-side context where `import.meta.env` functions. To remedy this, I'm focusing on integrating Vite's `loadEnv` function. The key is now understanding how to leverage the `mode` parameter within `defineConfig` to utilize `loadEnv` and make the `.env` variables available. My next steps involve a practical implementation demonstration, to show how to structure the configuration.


**Clarifying Environment Variable Usage**

I've determined the primary error stems from the incorrect use of `import.meta.env` in `vite.config.ts`. The linter correctly flags this, as the config file operates in a Node.js environment, unlike the client-side context where `import.meta.env` is accessible. To address this, I'm integrating Vite's `loadEnv` function within a function passed to `defineConfig`. This approach will enable dynamic loading of environment variables based on the current mode, providing flexibility and proper access to the desired `VITE_ASSET_PREFIX`. This should resolve the configuration and eliminate the linter errors.


**Resolving Configuration Load**

I've outlined a solution for the user's Vite configuration issue. They need to load `.env` variables correctly in `vite.config.ts`. The updated approach leverages `loadEnv` within a function that's passed to `defineConfig`. This addresses the linter errors and enables dynamic environment variable access based on the current mode, allowing for variable `base` path configuration. I also demonstrated a sample implementation showing how to correctly integrate the `loadEnv` function.


**Finalizing Configuration Integration**

I've finalized a comprehensive solution for the user. I've presented a detailed explanation of the problem, highlighting the incorrect usage of `import.meta.env` and the correct approach using `loadEnv` within a function passed to `defineConfig`. This updated code structure effectively handles environment variable loading and sets the correct `base` path.  My final version ensures that the `defineConfig` call resides within the functional scope, and also displays the correct usage and best practices.


**Revising .env Integration**

I'm now integrating `loadEnv` to correctly read `.env` variables within `vite.config.ts`. The updated logic will replace `import.meta.env` and provide the user with a dynamic `base` path based on the chosen environment mode. The implementation will offer a practical example of how to make this work.


**Addressing .env Variable Access**

I'm now implementing the `loadEnv` solution. The plan is to replace the incorrect `import.meta.env` with the `loadEnv` function within the `defineConfig` call. This should resolve the linter errors and allow for dynamic configuration of the `base` path based on the environment variables defined in `.env` files. I'll provide a working example to demonstrate its integration.


**Optimizing .env Variable Retrieval**

I've determined the correct approach: using `loadEnv` with the `mode` parameter within the `defineConfig` function is the most suitable method for the project's setup. This ensures that the configuration correctly loads environment variables from `.env` files based on the specified mode and sets the base path accordingly.
